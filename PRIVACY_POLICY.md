# Privacy Policy for RunWalk

**Last Updated: January 8, 2026**

## Overview

RunWalk ("the App") is a run-walk interval timer for iOS and watchOS. Your privacy is important to us, and we want to be transparent about our data practices.

## HealthKit Integration

RunWalk integrates with Apple HealthKit to enhance your workout experience. With your explicit permission, the App may:

**Write to HealthKit:**
- Workout sessions (run-walk interval workouts)
- Workout duration and activity type
- Active energy burned (calculated automatically during watchOS workouts)

**Read from HealthKit:**
- Your workout history (to display your past run-walk sessions)

### How We Use HealthKit Data

- **Save Workouts:** Completed workouts are saved to Apple Health so they contribute to your Activity Rings and workout history
- **Display History:** We read your workout data to show past run-walk sessions within the App

### HealthKit Data Protection

- All HealthKit data is protected by Apple's security framework
- HealthKit data remains on your device and within Apple's Health ecosystem
- We do NOT transmit HealthKit data to any servers
- We do NOT share HealthKit data with third parties
- We do NOT use HealthKit data for advertising or marketing

## Other Data Collection

- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track your location
- Does NOT access your contacts, photos, or other personal data
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking services
- Does NOT contain advertisements

## Data Storage

All app settings (such as your selected interval durations) are stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

You can manage the App's access to HealthKit at any time:
